To be completed BEFORE class 16 Jan, 2014

For each of the problems: railroad, soccer, spinids
- Read the problem description
- Write a pseudo code algorithm to solve the problem
  You may do this on paper or in an editor.
- Estimate the runtime of the algorithm, estimate the
  time for the largest problem.

Choose one of the problems listed above.
Implement your solution in a real language.
Build test input file(s) based on the description example(s).
Modify your code until it works on these sample(s).


To be completed DURING class 16 Jan, 2014
- Share your 2 pseudo code algorithms and 1 real code algorithm
  with at least 1 class member.
- Listen to at least one class member's algorithm for each problem.
- Have your code run against the larger test datasets to check
  for accuracy and speed.
