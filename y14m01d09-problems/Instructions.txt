To be completed in class 9 Jan, 2014.

Read the Ropes problem description in ropes.pdf.

Write a pseudo code algorithm to solve the problem.
You can do this on paper or in an editor.

Estimate the runtime of the algorithm.  Estimate the
time for the largest possible problem.

Describe your pseudo code to at least one class member.
Listen to at least one class member's pseudo code description.

Implement your solution in a real language.  Build a test input
file based on the description example.  Modify your code until
it works on these samples.
